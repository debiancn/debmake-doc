=== Other debian/* Files

Optional configuration files may be added under the *debian/* directory.  Most of them are to control *dh_** commands offered by the *debhelper* package but there are some for *dpkg-source*, *lintian* and *gbp* commands.

TIP: Check *debhelper*(7) for the latest available set of the *dh_** commands.

These **debian/**'binarypackage'**.*** files provide very powerful means to set the installation path of files.  Even an upstream source without its build system can be packaged just by using these files.  See <<nomakefile>> as an example.

The "^*-x[1234]*^" superscript notation that appears in the following list indicates the minimum value for the *debmake* *-x* option that will generate the associated template file.  See <<xoption>> or *debmake*(1) for details.

Here is the alphabetical list of notable optional configuration files.

'binarypackage'*.bug-control*  ^*-x3*^::
installed as *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/control* in 'binarypackage'. See <<bug>>.

'binarypackage'*.bug-presubj*  ^*-x3*^::
installed as *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/presubj* in 'binarypackage'. See <<bug>>.

'binarypackage'*.bug-script*  ^*-x3*^::
installed as *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage' or *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/script* in 'binarypackage'. See <<bug>>.

'binarypackage'*.bash-completion*::
List `bash` completion scripts to be installed.
+
The `bash-completion` package is required for both build and user environments.
+
See *dh_bash-completion*(1).

*clean* ^*-x2*^::
List files that should be removed but are not cleaned by the *dh_auto_clean* command.
+
See *dh_auto_clean*(1) and *dh_clean*(1).

*compat* ^*-x1*^::
Set the *debhelper* compatibility level (currently, ``*9*'').
+
See ``COMPATIBILITY LEVELS'' in *debhelper*(8).

'binarypackage'*.conffile*::
No need for this file under ``compat >= 3'' since all files in the *etc/* directory are conffiles.
+
--
If the program you're packaging requires every user to modify the configuration files in the */etc* directory, there are two popular ways to arrange for them not to be conffiles, keeping the *dpkg* command happy and quiet.

* Create a symlink under the */etc* directory pointing to a file under the */var* directory generated by the maintainer scripts.
* Create a file generated by the maintainer scripts under the */etc* directory.

--
+
See *dh_installdeb*(1).

// ======= //

Here are a few reminders for the above list.

* For a single binary package, the 'binarypackage'*.* part of the filename in the list may be removed.
* For a multi binary package, a configuration file missing the 'binarypackage'*.* part of the filename is applied to the first binary package listed in the *debian/control*.
* When there are many binary packages, their configurations can be specified independently by prefixing their name to their configuration filenames such as 'package-1'*.install*, 'package-2'*.install*, etc.
* Some template configuration files may not be created by the *debmake* command. In such cases, you need to create them with an editor.
* Unusual configuration template files generated by the *debmake* command with an extra *.ex* suffix need to be activated by removing that suffix.
* Unused configuration template files generated by the *debmake* command should be removed.
* Copy configuration template files as needed to the filenames matching their pertinent binary package names.
