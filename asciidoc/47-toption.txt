=== debmake -P

The *debmake* command invoked with the *-P* option pedantically checks auto-generated files for copyright+license text even if they are with permissive license.

This option affects not only the content of the *debian/copyright* file generated by normal execution, but also the output by the execution with the *-k*, *-c*, *-cc*, and *-ccc* options.

[[toption]]
=== debmake -T

The *debmake* command invoked with the *-T* option additionally prints verbose tutorial comment lines.  The lines marked with *&#35;&#35;&#35;* in the template files are part of the verbose tutorial comment lines.
