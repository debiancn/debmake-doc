Here are some notable options for the *debmake* command.

=== Shortcut options (-a, -i)

The *debmake* command offers 2 shortcut options.

* *-a* : open the upstream tarball
* *-i* : execute script to build the binary package

The example in the above <<simple>> can be done simply as follows.

----
 $ debmake -a package-1.0.tar.gz -i debuild
----

TIP: A URL such as ``*https://www.example.org/DL/package-1.0.tar.gz*'' may be used for the *-a* option.

TIP: A URL such as ``*https://arm.koji.fedoraproject.org/packages/ibus/1.5.7/3.fc21/src/ibus-1.5.7-3.fc21.src.rpm*'' may be used for the *-a* option, too.
