=== Bug reports

The *reportbug* command used for the bug report of 'binarypackage' can be customized by the files in *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/*.

The *dh_bugfiles* command installs these files from the template files in the *debian/* directory.

* *debian/*'binarypackage'*.bug-control*  ->  *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/control*
** This file contains some directions such as redirecting the bug report to another package.
* *debian/*'binarypackage'*.bug-presubj*  ->  *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/presubj*
** This file is displayed to the user by the *reportbug* command.
* *debian/*'binarypackage'*.bug-script*  -> *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage' or *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/script*
** The *reportbug* command runs this script to generate a template file for the bug report.

See *dh_bugfiles*(1) and file:///usr/share/doc/reportbug/README.developers.gz[reportbug's Features for Developers]

TIP: If you always remind the bug reporter of something or ask them about their
situation, use these files to automate it.
