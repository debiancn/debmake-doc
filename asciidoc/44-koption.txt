=== debmake -k

When updating a package for the new upstream release, the *debmake* command can verify the content of the existing *debian/copyright* file against the copyright and license situation of the entire updated source tree.

----
 $ cd package-vcs
 $ gbp import-orig --uscan --pristine-tar
 ... update source with the new upstream release
 $ debmake -k | less
----

The ``*debmake -k*'' command parses the *debian/copyright* file from the top to the bottom and compare the license of all the non-binary files in the current package with the license described in the last matching file pattern entry of the *debian/copyright* file.

When editing the auto-generated *debian/copyright* file, please make sure to keep the generic file patterns at the top of the list.

TIP: For all new upstream releases, run the ``*debmake -k*'' command to ensure that the *debian/copyright* file is current.
