=== Bootstrapping

https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBootstrap[Bootstrapping] is needed to support new
ports or flavour.  It is enabled by profile builds which add support for
minimal/reduced/staged builds to packages involved in build-dependency loops,
so that build loops are broken. Also ensure packages cross-build properly so
that an initial minimal native-building system can be produced.

TIP: If packages are required only in the `test` target, you can safely mark
the *Build-Depends* entries of such packages with *<!nocheck>* to avoid build
loops.
