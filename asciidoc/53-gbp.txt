===  git-buildpackage

The *git-buildpackage* package offers many commands to automate packaging activities using the git repository.

* *gbp import-dsc*: import the previous Debian source package to the git repository.
* *gbp import-orig*: import the new upstream tar to the git repository.
** The *--pristine-tar* option for the *git import-orig* command enables to store the upstream tarball in the same git repository.
** The *--uscan* option as the last argument of the *gbp import-orig* command enables to download and commit the new upstream tarball into the git repository.
* *gbp dch*: generate the Debian changelog from the git commit messages.
* *gbp buildpackage*: build the Debian binary package from the git repository.
* *gbp pull*: update the *debian*, *upstream* and *pristine-tar* branches safely from the remote repository.
* *git-pbuilder*: build the Debian binary package from the git repository using the *pbuilder* package.
** The *cowbuilder* package is used as its backend.
* The *gbp pq*, *git-dpm* or *quilt* (or alias *dquilt*) commands are used to manage quilt patches.
** The use of the *dquilt* command is the simplest to learn and requires you to commit the resulting files manually with the *git* command to the *master* branch.
** The use of the ``*gbp pq*'' command provides the equivalent functionality of the patch set management without using *dquilt* and eases including upstream git repository changes by the cherry-picking.
** The use of the ``*git dpm*'' command provides the more enhanced functionality than that of the `*gbp pq*'' command.

The package history management with the *git-buildpackage* package is becoming the standard practice for most Debian maintainers.

TIP:  Relax. You don't need to use all the wrapper tools.  Use only ones which match your needs.

==== gbp import-dscs --debsnap

For Debian source packages named '<source-package>' recorded in the http://snapshot.debian.org/[snapshot.debian.org] archive, an initial git repository with all of the Debian version history can be generated as follows.
