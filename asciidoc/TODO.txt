Piuparts
Tests installation and removal of packages
Process :
cleans up a chroot (removes everything except apt)
installs the package to test and its dependencies
Removes everything, purge all dependencies
Purges the package to test
⇒ test of the package maintainer scripts
(preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm)
under the most extreme conditions

Piuparts (2)
Also tests other things :
upgrades
running processes after removal
dangling symlinks
files left after removal/purge, files from other packages
modified

Piuparts and false positives
Piuparts generates A LOT of false positives
To be tested, a package must be able to install non-interactively
debconf is nice (Non-interactive frontend)
but doesn’t solve everything (e.g packages that need
access a database)
⇒ Make all packages use debconf
⇒ After that, not much to do about false positives


Piuparts and set theory
Problem : how can one easily get a list of real failures, without
false positives ?
⇒ Set theory !
Example : find packages that fail to install because of a missing
depend on debconf.
Run piuparts over all packages, without debconf installed
Fetch the list of failures
For each package that failed during the first run,
re-run piuparts with debconf installed
Packages that succeeded = our list of failures
