debmake - program to make the Debian source package

== SYNOPSIS

*debmake*  [*-h*]  [*-c* | *-k*] [*-n* | *-a* 'package-version'*.orig.tar.gz* | *-d* | *-t* ] [*-p* 'package'] [*-u* 'version'] [*-r* 'revision'] [*-z* 'extension'] [*-b* "'binarypackage'[:__type__]__, ...__]" [*-e* 'foo@example.org'] [*-f* "'firstname lastname'"] [*-i* "'buildtool'" | *-j*] [*-l* 'license_file'] [*-m*] [*-o* 'file'] [*-q*] [*-s*] [*-v*] [*-w* "'addon, ...'"] [*-x* [01234]] [*-y*] [*-P*] [*-T*]


== DESCRIPTION

*debmake* helps to build the Debian package from the upstream source.  Normally, this is done as follows:

* The upstream tarball is downloaded as the 'package-version'**.tar.gz** file.
* It is untared to create many files under the 'package-version/' directory.
* debmake is invoked in the 'package-version/' directory possibly without any arguments.
* Files in the 'package-version'**/debian/** directory are manually adjusted.
* *dpkg-buildpackage* (usually from its wrapper *debuild* or *pdebuild*) is invoked in the 'package-version/' directory to make Debian packages.

Make sure to protect the arguments of the *-b*, *-f*, *-l*, and *-w* options from the shell interference by quoting them properly.

=== optional arguments:

*-h*, *--help*::
show this help message and exit.

*-c*, *--copyright*::
scan source for copyright+license text and exit.
+
* *-c*: simple output style
* *-cc*: normal output style (similar to the *debian/copyright* file)
* *-ccc*: debug output style

*-k*, *--kludge*::
compare the *debian/copyright* file with the source and exit.
+
The *debian/copyright* file must be organized to list the generic file patterns before the specific exceptions.
+
* *-k*: basic output style
* *-kk*: verbose output style

*-n*, *--native*::
make a native Debian source package without *.orig.tar.gz*.  This makes the ``*3.0 (native)*'' format package.
+
If you are thinking to package a Debian specific source tree with *debian/** in it into a native Debian package, please think otherwise.  You can use  ``*debmake -d  -i debuild*'' or ``*debmake -t -i debuild*'' to make the ``*3.0 (quilt)*'' format non-native Debian package.  The only difference is that the *debian/changelog* file must use the  non-native version scheme: 'version-revision'.  The non-native package is more friendly to the downstream distributions.

*-a* 'package-version'**.tar.gz**, *--archive* 'package-version'**.tar.gz**::
use the upstream source tarball directly. (*-p*, *-u*, *-z*: overridden)
+
The upstream tarball may be specified as 'package_version'**.orig.tar.gz** and *tar.gz* for all cases may be *tar.bz2*, or *tar.xz*.
+
If the specified upstream tarball name contains uppercase letters, the Debian package name is generated by converting them to lowercase letters.
+
If the specified argument is the URL (http://, https://, or ftp://) to the upstream tarball, the upstream tarball is downloaded from the URL using *wget* or *curl*.

*-d*, *--dist*::
run ``make dist'' equivalent first to generate upstream tarball and use it.
+
``*debmake -d*'' is designed to run in the 'package/' directory hosting the upstream VCS with the build system supporting ``*make dist*'' equivalents.  (automake/autoconf, Python distutils, ...)

*-t*, *--tar*::
run ``*tar*'' to generate upstream tarball and use it
+
``*debmake -t*'' is designed to run in the 'package/' directory hosting the upstream VCS.  Unless you provide the upstream version with the *-u* option or with the *debian/changelog* file, a snapshot upstream version is generated in the *0\~%y%m%d%H%M* format, e.g., '0~1403012359', from the UTC date and time.  The generated tarball excludes the *debian/* directory found in the upstream VCS. (It also excludes typical VCS directories: **.git/ .hg/ .svn/ .CVS/**)

*-p* 'package', *--package* 'package'::
set the Debian package name.

*-u* 'version', *--upstreamversion* 'version'::
set the upstream package version.

*-r* 'revision', *--revision* 'revision'::
set the Debian package revision.

*-z* 'extension', *--targz* 'extension'::
set the tarball type, 'extension'=(*tar.gz*|*tar.bz2*|*tar.xz*) (alias: *z*, *b*, *x*)

*-b* "'binarypackage[:type],...'", *--binaryspec* "'binarypackage[:type],...'"::
set binary package specs by the comma separated list of 'binarypackage:type' pairs, e.g., in full form ``*foo:bin,foo-doc:doc,libfoo1:lib,libfoo1-dbg:dbg,libfoo-dev:dev*'' or in short form ``*,-doc,libfoo1,libfoo1-dbg, libfoo-dev*''.
+
Here, 'binarypackage' is the binary package name; and optional 'type' is chosen from the following 'type' values:
+
--
** *bin*: C/C++ compiled ELF binary code package (any, foreign) (default, alias: *""*, i.e., 'null-string')
** *data*: Data (fonts, graphics, ...) package (all, foreign) (alias: *da*)
** *dbg*: Debug symbol package (any, same) (alias: *db*) (deprecated for strech and after since the -dbgsym package is automatically generated)
** *dev*: Library development package (any, same) (alias: *de*)
** *doc*: Documentation package (all, foreign) (alias: *do*)
** *lib*: Library package (any, same) (alias: *l*)
** *perl*: Perl script package (all, foreign) (alias: *pl*)
** *python*: Python script package (all, foreign) (alias: *py*)
** *python3*: Python3 script package (all, foreign) (alias: *py3*)
** *ruby*: Ruby script package (all, foreign) (alias: *rb*)
** *script*: Shell script package (all, foreign) (alias: *sh*)
--
+
The pair values in the parentheses, such as (any, foreign), are the *Architecture* and *Multi-Arch* stanza values set in the *debian/control* file.
+
In many cases, the *debmake* command makes good guesses for 'type' from 'binarypackage'.  If 'type' is not obvious, 'type' is set to *bin*.  For example, *libfoo* sets 'type' to *lib*, and *font-bar* sets 'type' to *data*, ...
+
If the source tree contents do not match settings for 'type', *debmake* warns you.

*-e* 'foo@example.org', *--email* 'foo@example.org'::
set e-mail address.
+
The default is taken from the value of the environment variable *$DEBEMAIL*.

*-f* "'firstname lastname'", *--fullname* "'firstname lastname'"::
set the fullname.
+
The default is taken from the value of the environment variable *$DEBFULLNAME*.

*-i* "'buildtool'", *--invoke* "'buildtool'"::
invoke "'buildtool'" at the end of execution.  'buildtool' may be ``*dpkg-buildpackage*'', ``*debuild*'', ``*pdebuild*'', ``*pdebuild  --pbuilder cowbuilder*'', etc..
+
The default is not to execute any program.

*-j*, *--judge*::
run *dpkg-depcheck* to judge build dependencies and identify file paths.  Log files are in the parent directory.

* 'package'**.build-dep.log**: Log file for *dpkg-depcheck*.
* 'package'**.install.log**: Log file recording files in the *debian/tmp* directory.
//

*-l* "'license_file,...'", *--license* "'license_file,...'"::
add formatted license text to the end of the *debian/copyright* file holding license scan results
+
The default is add *COPYING* and *LICENSE* and 'license_file' needs to list only the additional file names all separated by ``*,*''.

*-m*, *--monoarch*::
force packages to be non-multiarch.

*-o* 'file', *--option* 'file'::
read optional parameters from the 'file'. (This is not for everyday use.)
+
The 'file' is sourced as the Python3 code at the end of *para.py*.  For example, the package description can be specified by the following file.
+
----
para['desc'] = 'program short description'
para['desc_long'] = '''\
 program long description which you wish to include.
 .
 Empty line is space + .
 You keep going on ...
'''
----

//

*-q*, *--quitearly*::
quit early before creating files in the *debian/* directory.

*-s*, *--spec*::
use upstream spec (setup.py for Python, etc.) for the package description.

*-v*, *--version*::
show version information.

*-w* "'addon,...'", *--with* "'addon,...'"::
add extra arguments to the *--with* option of the *dh*(1) command as 'addon' in *debian/rules*.
+
The 'addon' values are listed all separated by ``*,*'', e.g., ``*-w "python2,autoreconf"''*.
+
For  Autotools based packages, setting *autoreconf* as 'addon' forces to run ``*autoreconf -i -v -f*'' for every package building.  Otherwise, *autotools-dev* as 'addon' is used as default.
+
For Autotools based packages, if they install Python programs, *python2* as addon is needed for packages with ``*compat < 9*'' since this is non-obvious.   But for *setup.py* based packages, *python2* as 'addon' is not needed since this is obvious and it is automatically set for the *dh*(1) command by the *debmake* command when it is required.

*-x* 'n', *--extra* 'n'::
generate extra configuration files as templates.
+
The number 'n' changes which configuration templates are generated.

* *-x0*: bare minimum configuration files. (default if these files exist already)
* *-x1*: ,, + desirable configuration files. (default for new packages)
* *-x2*: ,, + interesting configuration files. (recommended for experts, multi binary aware)
* *-x3*:  ,,  + unusual configuration template files with the extra *.ex* suffix to ease their removal. (recommended for new users) To use these as configuration files, rename their file names into ones without the *.ex* suffix.
* *-x4*: ,, + copyright file examples.
//
Existing configuration files are never overwritten.  If you wish to update some of the existing configuration files, please rename them  before  running  the *debmake* command and manually merge the generated configuration files with the old renamed ones.

*-y*, *--yes*::
``force yes'' for all prompts. (without option: ``ask [Y/n]''; doubled option: ``force no'')

*-P*, *--pedantic*::
pedantically check auto-generated files.

*-T*, *--tutorial*::
output tutorial comment lines in template files.

== EXAMPLES

For  a  well  behaving  source, you can build a good-for-local-use installable single Debian binary package easily with one command.  Test install of such a package
generated in this way offers a good alternative to traditional ``*make install*'' to the */usr/local* directory since the Debian package can be  removed  cleanly  by  the
``*dpkg -P* '...''' command. Here are some examples of how to build such test packages. (These should work in most cases.  If the *-d* does not work, try *-t* instead.)

For a typical C program source tree packaged with autoconf/automake:

* *debmake -d -i debuild*

For a typical python module source tree:

* *debmake -s -d -b":python" -i debuild*

For a typical python module in the 'package-version'**.tar.gz** archive:

* *debmake -s -a 'package-version'.tar.gz -b":python" -i debuild*

For a typical perl module in the 'Package-version'*.tar.gz* archive:

* *debmake -a 'Package-version'.tar.gz -b":perl" -i debuild*


== HELPER PACKAGES

Packaging may require installation of some additional specialty helper packages.

* Python3 program may require the *dh-python* package.

* Autotools (Autoconf + Automake) build system may require *autotools-dev* or *dh-autoreconf* package.

* Ruby program may require the *gem2deb* package.

* Java program may require the *javahelper* package.

* Gnome programs may require the *gobject-introspection* package.

* etc.

== CAVEAT

*debmake* is meant to provide template files for the package maintainer to work on.  Comment lines started by *&#35;* contain the tutorial text.  You must remove or edit such comment lines before uploading to the Debian archive.

The license extraction and assignment process involves a lot of heuristics, it may fail in some cases.  It is highly recommended to use other tools such as *licensecheck* from the *devscripts* package in conjunction with *debmake*.

There  are some limitations for what characters may be used as a part of the Debian package.  The most notable limitation is the prohibition of uppercase letters in the package name.  Here is the summary in the regular expression.

* Upstream package name (**-p**): [-+.a-z0-9]{2,}
* Binary package name (*-b*): [-+.a-z0-9]{2,}
* Upstream version (*-u*): [0-9][-+.:~a-z0-9A-Z]*
* Debian revision (*-r*): [0-9][+.~a-z0-9A-Z]*

See the exact definition in http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html[Chapter 5 - Control files and their fields] of the ``Debian Policy Manual''.

*debmake* assumes relatively simple packaging cases.  So all programs related to the interpreter are assumed to be "*Architecture: all*".  This is not always true.

== DEBUG

Please report bugs to *debmake* using *reportbug*.

The character set in the environment variable *$DEBUG* determines the logging output level.

// * *ghjoqrstuvwxz*:

* *i*: print information
* *p*: list all global parameters
* *d*: list parsed parameters for all binary packages
* *f*: input filename for the copyright scan
* *y*: year/name split of copyright line
* *s*: line scanner for format_state
* *b*: content_state scan loop: begin-loop
* *m*: content_state scan loop: after regex match
* *e*: content_state scan loop: end-loop
* *c*: print copyright section text
* *l*: print license section text
* *a*: print author/translator section text
* *k*: sort key for debian/copyright stanza
* *n*: scan result of debian/copyright (``*debmake -k*'')
