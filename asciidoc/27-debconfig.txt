=== Other debian/*

Optional configuration files may be added under the *debian/* directory.  Most of them are to control *dh_** commands offered by the *debhelper* package but there are some for *lintian* and *gbp* commands.  Here is the alphabetical list of notable optional configuration files.

'binarypackage'*.bug-control*  ^*-x3*^::
installed as *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/control* in 'binarypackage'. See <<bug>>.

'binarypackage'*.bug-presubj*  ^*-x3*^::
installed as *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/presubj* in 'binarypackage'. See <<bug>>.

'binarypackage'*.bug-script*  ^*-x3*^::
installed as *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage' or *usr/share/bug/*'binarypackage'*/script* in 'binarypackage'. See <<bug>>.

*clean* ^*-x2*^::
List files which should be removed but are not cleaned by the *dh_auto_clean* command.
+
See *dh_auto_clean*(1) and *dh_clean*(1).

*compat* ^*-x1*^::
Set the *debhelper* compatibility level (currently, ``*9*'').
+
See ``COMPATIBILITY LEVELS'' in *debhelper*(8).

'binarypackage'*.conffile*::
No need for this file under ``compat >= 3'' since all files in the *etc/* directory are conffiles.
+
See *dh_installdeb*(1).
+
If the program you're packaging requires every user to modify the configuration files in the */etc* directory, there are two popular ways to arrange for them to not be conffiles, keeping the *dpkg* command happy and quiet.

* Create a symlink under the */etc* directory pointing to a file under the */var* directory generated by the maintainer scripts.
* Create a file generated by the maintainer scripts under the */etc* directory.

'binarypackage'*.config*::
This is the *debconf* *config* script used for asking any questions necessary to configure the package.  See <<debconf>>.

See *dh_installinit*(1).

'binarypackage'*.dirs* ^*-x3*^::
List directories to be created in 'binarypackage'.

// ======= //

Here are a few reminders to the above list.

* For the single binary package, 'binarypackage'*.* part of the filename in the list may be removed.
* For the multi binary package, configuration file missing 'binarypackage'*.* part of the filename is applied to the first binary package listed in the *debian/control*.
* When there are many binary packages, their configurations can be specified independently by prefixing their name to their configuration filenames such as 'package-1'*.install*, 'package-2'*.install*, etc.
* Configuration template filenames with ^*-x1*^, ^*-x2*^, ^*-x3*^, or ^*-x4*^ in the above mean that they are generated by the *debmake* command with that *-x* option (see <<xoption>>).
* Some template configuration files may not be created by the *debmake* command. In such cases, you need to create them with an editor.
* Unusual configuration template files generated by the *debmake* command with the extra *.ex* suffix needs to be activated by removing that suffix.
* Unused configuration template files generated by the *debmake* command should be removed.
* Copy configuration template files as needed to the filenames matching their pertinent binary package names.
