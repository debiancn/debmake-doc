[[autotools-single]]
=== Autotools (single-binary package)

Here is an example of creating a simple Debian package from a simple C source program using Autotools = Autoconf and Automake (*Makefile.am* and *configure.ac*) as its build system. See <<autotools>>.

This source usually comes with the upstream auto-generated *Makefile.in* and *configure* files, too.  This source can be packaged using these files as in <<configure-single>> with the help of the *autotools-dev* package.

The better alternative is to regenerate these files using the latest Autoconf and Automake packages if the upstream provided *Makefile.am* and *configure.ac* are compatible with the latest version.  This is advantageous for porting to new CPU architectures, etc.  This can be automated by using the ``*--with autoreconf*'' option for the *dh* command.

Let's assume this upstream tarball to be *debhello-1.6.tar.gz*.

This type of source is meant to be installed as a non-system file, for example, as:

----
 $ tar -xzmf debhello-1.6.tar.gz
 $ cd debhello-1.6
 $ autoreconf -ivf # optional
 $ ./configure --with-math
 $ make
 $ make install
----

Let's get the source and make the Debian package.

.Download *debhello-1.6.tar.gz*
----
include::../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step000.slog[]
----

Here, the contents of this source are as follows.

.*src/hello.c* (v=1.6):
----
include::../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step101.slog[]
----

.*Makefile.am* (v=1.6):
----
include::../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step102.slog[]
----

.*configure.ac* (v=1.6):
----
include::../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step103.slog[]
----

TIP: Without ``*foreign*'' strictness level specified in *AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE()* as above, *automake* defaults to ``*gnu*'' strictness level requiring several files in the top-level directory.  See ``3.2 Strictness'' in the *automake* document.  

Let's package this with the *debmake* command.

----
sys::[head -n12  ../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step200.slog]
...
----

The result is similar to <<configure-single>> but not exactly the same.

Let's inspect the notable template files generated.

// .The source tree after the basic *debmake* execution. (v=1.6)
// ----
// include::../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step201.slog[]
// ----

.*debian/rules* (template file, v=1.6):
----
include::../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step202.slog[]
----

Let's make this Debian package better as the maintainer.

.*debian/rules* (maintainer version, v=1.6):
----
include::../debhello-1.6-pkg1/step301.slog[]
----

There are several other template files under the *debian/* directory.  These also need to be updated.

The rest of the packaging activities are practically the same as the one in <<step-debuild>>.
