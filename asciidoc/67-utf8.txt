[[utf-8-build]]
=== Build under UTF-8

The default locale of the build environment is *C*.

Some programs such as the *read* function of Python3 change their behavior depending on the locale.

Adding the following code to the *debian/rules* file ensures building the program under the *C.UTF-8* locale.

----
LC_ALL := C.UTF-8
export LC_ALL
----

[[utf-8-conv]]
=== UTF-8 conversion

If upstream documents are encoded in old encoding schemes, converting them to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[UTF-8] is a good idea.

Use the *iconv* command in the *libc-bin* package to convert encodings of plain text files.

----
 $ iconv -f latin1 -t utf8 foo_in.txt > foo_out.txt
----

Use *w3m*(1) to convert from HTML files to UTF-8 plain text files. When you do this, make sure to execute it under UTF-8 locale.
----
 $ LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 w3m -o display_charset=UTF-8 \
        -cols 70 -dump -no-graph -T text/html \
        < foo_in.html > foo_out.txt
----

Run these scripts in the *override_dh_** target of the *debian/rules* file.
