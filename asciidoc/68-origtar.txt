[[origtar]]
=== Upload *orig.tar.gz*

When you first upload the package to the archive, you need to include the original *orig.tar.gz* source, too.

If the Debian revision number of the package is either *1* or *0*, this is the default.  Otherwise, you must provide the *dpkg-buildpackage* option *-sa* to the *dpkg-buildpackage* command.

* *dpkg-buildpackage -sa*
* *debuild -sa*
* *pdebuild --debbuildopts -sa*
* *git-pbuilder -sa*
* For *gbp buildpackage*, edit the *~/.gbp.conf* file.

TIP: On the other hand, the *-sd* option will force the exclusion of the original *orig.tar.gz* source.

TIP: Security uploads require including the *orig.tar.gz* file.

[[skipedupload]]
=== Skipped uploads

If you created multiple entries in the *debian/changelog* while skipping uploads, you must create a proper **_.changes* file which includes all changes since the last upload. This can be done by specifying the dpkg-buildpackage option *-v* with the last uploaded version, e.g., '1.2'.


* *dpkg-buildpackage -v*'1.2'
* *debuild -v*'1.2'
* *pdebuild --debbuildopts -v*'1.2'
* *git-pbuilder -v*'1.2'
* For *gbp buildpackage*, edit the *~/.gbp.conf* file.
