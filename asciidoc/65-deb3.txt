=== 3.0 source format

Updating the package style is not a required activity for the update of a package. However, doing so lets you use the full capabilities of the modern *debhelper* system and the *3.0* source format.

* If you need to recreate deleted template files for any reason, you can run *debmake* again in the same Debian package source tree. Then edit them appropriately.
* If the package has not been updated to use the *dh* command for the *debian/rules* file, update it to use it (see <<simplerules>>). Update the *debian/control* file accordingly.
* If you have a *1.0* source package with the *foo.diff.gz* file, you can update it to the newer ``*3.0 (quilt)*'' source format by creating *debian/source/format* with ``*3.0 (quilt)*''. The rest of the **debian/*** files can just be copied. Import the *big.diff* file generated by the ``**filterdiff -z -x '*/debian/*' foo.diff.gz > big.diff**'' command to your quilt system, if needed. footnote:[You can split the *big.diff* file into many small incremental patch files using the *splitdiff* command.]
* If it was packaged using another patch system such as *dpatch*, *dbs*, or *cdbs* with *-p0*, *-p1*, or *-p2*, convert it to the quilt command using the *deb3* script in the *quilt* package.
* If it was packaged with the *dh* command with the ``*--with quilt*'' option or with the *dh_quilt_patch* and *dh_quilt_unpatch* commands, remove these and make it use the newer ``*3.0 (quilt)*'' source format.
* If you have a *1.0* source package without the *foo.diff.gz* file, you can update it to the newer ``*3.0 (native)*'' source format by creating *debian/source/format* with ``*3.0 (native)*''. The rest of the **debian/*** files can just be copied.

You should check http://dep.debian.net/[DEP - Debian Enhancement Proposals] and adopt ACCEPTED proposals.

See https://wiki.debian.org/Projects/DebSrc3.0[ProjectsDebSrc3.0] to check the support status of the new Debian source formats by the Debian tool chains.
