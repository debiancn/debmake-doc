=== Compiler hardening

The compiler hardening support spreading for Debian *jessie* (8.0, TBA) demands that we pay extra attention to the packaging.

You should read the following references in detail.

* Debian wiki https://wiki.debian.org/Hardening[Hardening]
* Debian wiki https://wiki.debian.org/HardeningWalkthrough[Hardening Walkthrough]

The *debmake* command adds template comments to the *debian/rules* file as needed for *DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS*, *DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND*, and *DEB_LDFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND* (see <<simple>> and *dpkg-buildflags*(1)).
