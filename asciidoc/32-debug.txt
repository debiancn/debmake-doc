=== Debugging information

The Debian package is built with the debugging information but packaged into the binary package after stripping the debugging information as required by https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#document-ch-files[Chapter 10 - Files] of the ``Debian Policy Manual''.

==== New -dbgsym package (Strech 9.0 and after)

The debugging information is automatically packaged separately as the debug package using the *dh_strip* command with its default behavior.  The name of such a debug package normally has the *-dbgsym* suffix.

* No special care is needed in the *debian/rules* file, if there were no *-dbg* packages.
* Use the *--dbgsym-migration* option for the *dh_strip* command, if there were *-dbg* packages.

==== Old -dbg package (Jessie 8.0 or before)

The debugging information can be packaged separately as the debug package using the ``*dh_strip --dbg-package=*'package''' command in the *override_dh_strip:* target of the *debian/rules* file.  The name of such a debug package normally has the *-dbg* suffix.

The installation path of the debugging information is as follows to enable auto-loading of it by the *gdb* command.

* */usr/lib/debug/.build-id/*'12/3456...' (compat>=9, for *buildID*='123456...')
* */usr/lib/debug/*'path/to/binary' (compat<<9, for '/path/to/binary')

NOTE: The creation of the *-dbg* package is optional.

NOTE: This is deprecated for Strech 9.0 and after.
